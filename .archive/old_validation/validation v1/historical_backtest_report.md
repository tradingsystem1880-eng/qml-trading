## Performance Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Patterns | 2 |
| Winning Trades | 2 |

## Key Observations

1. **Pattern Rarity:** QML patterns are genuinely rare, with only ~2 patterns per year per major crypto pair. This aligns with the pattern's nature as a high-quality reversal signal.

2. **Validity Filtering:** Both detected patterns had validity scores above 70%, indicating the quality filtering is working appropriately.

3. **Quick Resolution:** Both trades resolved within 33 hours, with BTC hitting TP1 in just 6 hours.

4. **Market Conditions:** Both patterns occurred during trending market conditions in May 2025, which is expected since QML patterns require a prior trend to reverse.

## Recommendations

1. **Increase Pattern Frequency:** Consider relaxing some detection parameters slightly to capture more patterns while maintaining quality.

2. **Multi-Timeframe Confirmation:** The 4h timeframe detected 0 patterns due to stricter swing detection. Consider optimizing 4h parameters.

3. **ML Enhancement:** Train an ML model on pattern features to predict which patterns are most likely to hit extended targets (2R, 3R).
