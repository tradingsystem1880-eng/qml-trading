    "description": "Price-action driven detection using ATR Directional Change. Instead of blindly iterating every N bars, this approach processes data bar-by-bar and triggers pattern detection ONLY when ATR confirms a new market extreme (swing high or swing low). This aligns software logic with market structure.",
